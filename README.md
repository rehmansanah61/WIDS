Rubik's Cube Solver
Description
This project is a 3D Rubik's Cube simulator and solver implemented in Python using VPython. It provides a visual representation of a Rubik's Cube that can be manipulated and solved algorithmically.
Features
3D visualization of a Rubik's Cube
Interactive cube rotation and manipulation
Automatic scrambling of the cube
Step-by-step solving algorithm
Custom color scheme
Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
Install required dependencies:
text
pip install vpython
